The TODO list can be found on Trac for wp-plugins.org:
http://dev.wp-plugins.org/report/9?COMPONENT=upcoming-events

New ideas as well as bug reports can be filed as tickets in Trax.

Target are, of course, subject to change and future versions will probably
have more features in them than just what's on the list.
