Instead of a bug tracker, I'm just going to use a simple TODO list for now.
Target are, of course, subject to change and future versions will probably
have more features in them than just what's on this list.


Configuration Validation - 0.2

	Currently little to no validation is done on items submitted using
	the admin interface. Everything should be validated and the admin
	should have to correct errors before changes are saved


Remove Feeds - 0.2

	0.1 provides no ability to remove a feed once it's been added. While
	removing feeds will probably be rare, it should be possible.


Date formatting option - 0.3

	This one should be easy, but provide an option to define how the
	date is formatted in the sidebar


Make Popus of Events - 0.3

	Use JavaScript and the DOM in order to make a fancy tooltip that
	provides more information about an event


Colors for Different Feeds - 0.4

	Have the ability for the admin to define different colors for
	each feed
