Upcoming Events is a plugin that can receive iCalendar feeds from third party
sites and display aggregated upcoming events from multiple feeds. As of this
time, it has received very little testing, but it is working on the author's
site using two feeds from Google and one from ical.mac.com. This first
release version provides the ability to add a virtually unlimited number of
feeds, but does not contain the ability to delete any (feeds can be hidden
so they don't show up in the sidebar).

ICS files are locally cached and will be automatically updated when they reach
a certain age. This age is configurable both as a global default and
individually for each user. The options range from 1 Hour to 1 Year with many
available options in between.

== Installation ==

Installation is pretty standard. Simply place the contents of the
"upcoming-events" directory into your WordPress plugins directory and visit
the Plugins page in the WordPress Admin Interface to active the plugin.
Configuration options will then be available from the "Upcoming Events" page
of the "Options" tab.
